# Story 4.1: Worker Process Foundation

**Epic:** 4 - Worker Orchestration & Parallel Processing
**Priority:** Critical (Foundation for Multi-Channel Video Processing)
**Story Points:** 8 (Complex worker architecture with PostgreSQL integration and async execution)
**Status:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT

## Story Description

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** independent worker processes that can be scaled horizontally,
**So that** I can add processing capacity by launching more workers (FR38).

## Context & Background

The worker process foundation is the **FIRST STORY in Epic 4** and establishes the core architecture for multi-channel video processing at scale. It creates the fundamental worker process structure that will later integrate with PgQueuer for task claiming (Story 4.2) and implement the full 8-step video generation pipeline.

**Critical Requirements:**

1. **Separate Process Architecture**: Each worker runs as an independent Python process (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3 on Railway)
2. **Async Execution**: All database operations and I/O must use async/await patterns to prevent blocking
3. **Short Transaction Pattern**: Claim task → close DB → process → reopen DB → update (NEVER hold DB during long operations)
4. **Horizontal Scalability**: Stateless design allows adding more workers dynamically (worker-4, worker-5, etc.)
5. **Railway Deployment**: Workers run as separate Railway services with shared PostgreSQL database
6. **Entry Point**: `app/worker.py` serves as worker process entry point, runs continuous event loop
7. **Database Integration**: Workers use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns with asyncpg driver

**Why Worker Foundation is Critical:**

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple channels can generate videos simultaneously (5-10 concurrent channels)
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add capacity by launching more worker processes on Railway ($5/month per worker)
- **Fault Isolation**: One worker crash doesn't affect other workers or the web service
- **Performance**: 3 workers can handle 100 videos/week (14.3 videos/day average) across multiple channels
- **Foundation for Future Stories**: Task claiming (Story 4.2), priority queues (Story 4.3), and orchestration (Story 4.8) build on this foundation

**Referenced Architecture:**

- Architecture: Worker Process Design - Separate Processes (3 independent Python processes)
- Architecture: Database Architecture - Connection pooling (pool_size=10, max_overflow=5, pool_pre_ping=True)
- Architecture: Short Transaction Pattern (Architecture Decision 3) - CRITICAL
- project-context.md: Critical Implementation Rules (lines 56-119)
- PRD: FR38 (Horizontal scaling via multiple independent worker processes)
- PRD: NFR-PER-001 (Async I/O throughout backend for non-blocking execution)

**Key Architectural Pattern (From Stories 3.1-3.8):**

The worker foundation follows the "Short Transaction Pattern" established in Epic 3:

```python
# Step 1: Claim task (short transaction)
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
    task.status = "processing"
    await db.commit()

# Step 2: Process (OUTSIDE transaction - could be minutes)
result = await process_pipeline_step(task)

# Step 3: Update task (short transaction)
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
    task.status = "completed"
    await db.commit()
```

**Worker Process Architecture (From Architecture Document):**

- **Deployment**: 3 Railway services (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3), each running `python -m app.worker`
- **Task Claiming**: Independent claiming via PgQueuer FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (Story 4.2 will implement)
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL with connection pooling (pool_size=10, supports 3 workers + web service)
- **Scaling**: Stateless design, add more workers dynamically by creating worker-4, worker-5, etc.
- **Entry Point**: `app/worker.py` runs continuous loop, exits on SIGTERM for graceful shutdown

**Existing Implementation Analysis (from Stories 3.1-3.8):**

Epic 3 established the complete 8-step video generation pipeline with 8 service modules:
- Story 3.1: CLI script wrapper (`app/utils/cli_wrapper.py`)
- Story 3.2: Filesystem helpers (`app/utils/filesystem.py`)
- Story 3.3: Asset generation service (`app/services/asset_generation.py`)
- Story 3.4: Composite creation service (`app/services/composite_creation.py`)
- Story 3.5: Video generation service (`app/services/video_generation.py`)
- Story 3.6: Narration generation service (`app/services/narration_generation.py`)
- Story 3.7: Sound effects generation service (`app/services/sound_effects_generation.py`)
- Story 3.8: Video assembly service (`app/services/video_assembly.py`)

Each service implements a step-specific worker function (e.g., `process_asset_generation_task()`). Story 4.1 creates the foundational worker process that will orchestrate these services.

**Database Schema (Existing from Epic 1 & 2):**

- **channels** table (Story 1.1): Channel configuration with encrypted credentials
- **tasks** table (Story 2.1): Task tracking with 9-state workflow (pending → claimed → processing → awaiting_review → approved/rejected → completed/failed/retry)
- **videos** table (Story 2.1): Video metadata and file paths
- **video_costs** table (Story 3.3): Per-component cost tracking
- **audit_logs** table (Story 1.1): Compliance logging for human actions

**Deployment Configuration (Railway):**

```yaml
# railway.json structure (to be created in Story 4.1)
services:
  web:
    build: {dockerfile: "Dockerfile"}
    start: "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
    healthcheck: "/health"

  worker-1:
    build: {dockerfile: "Dockerfile"}
    start: "python -m app.worker"

  worker-2:
    build: {dockerfile: "Dockerfile"}
    start: "python -m app.worker"

  worker-3:
    build: {dockerfile: "Dockerfile"}
    start: "python -m app.worker"

  postgres:
    image: "postgres:16"
```

**Derived from Previous Stories (Epic 3 Learnings):**

- ✅ Short transaction pattern successfully used in all 8 Epic 3 stories (commits: 1314620, a85176e, f799965)
- ✅ Async execution prevents event loop blocking (all services use `async/await`)
- ✅ Service layer pattern established (business logic in `app/services/`, orchestration in workers)
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs (`structlog` JSON format)
- ✅ CLI wrapper pattern (`run_cli_script()` with timeout handling)
- ✅ Filesystem helpers prevent path traversal attacks (regex validation)
- ✅ Error handling with retry classification (retriable vs non-retriable)

**Key Technical Decisions:**

1. **No PgQueuer in Story 4.1**: Task claiming with PgQueuer is Story 4.2. Story 4.1 creates the worker loop structure only.
2. **Worker Entry Point**: `app/worker.py` is the entry point, imports and calls pipeline orchestrator (Story 3.9 or Story 4.8)
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers listen for SIGTERM signal to finish current task before exiting
4. **Connection Pooling**: Shared pool across workers (pool_size=10 sufficient for 3 workers + web service)
5. **Local Development**: Workers can run in separate terminals with `python -m app.worker` for testing

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Worker Process Startup and Initialization
**Given** Railway worker service (worker-1) starts with `python -m app.worker`
**When** the worker process initializes
**Then** the worker should:
- ✅ Load configuration from environment variables (DATABASE_URL, FERNET_KEY)
- ✅ Initialize async database engine with connection pooling (pool_size=10, max_overflow=5, pool_pre_ping=True)
- ✅ Initialize structured logging with worker identifier (worker_id) in all log messages
- ✅ Log startup message with worker_id and configuration summary
- ✅ Enter continuous event loop waiting for work
- ✅ Not exit unless SIGTERM received or fatal error occurs

### Scenario 2: Database Connection Pool Configuration
**Given** 3 workers (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3) and 1 web service share PostgreSQL
**When** workers initialize database connections
**Then** the connection pool should:
- ✅ Use `create_async_engine()` with DATABASE_URL from environment
- ✅ Configure pool_size=10 (supports 3 workers + web service concurrent operations)
- ✅ Configure max_overflow=5 (burst capacity for peak load)
- ✅ Configure pool_timeout=30 seconds (fail fast on exhaustion)
- ✅ Configure pool_pre_ping=True (handle Railway connection recycling)
- ✅ Use asyncpg driver (postgresql+asyncpg:// protocol)
- ✅ Share single engine instance across all worker operations

### Scenario 3: Async Session Factory for Workers
**Given** worker needs to interact with database
**When** worker creates database session
**Then** the session factory should:
- ✅ Use `async_sessionmaker()` with AsyncSession class
- ✅ Configure expire_on_commit=False (prevent lazy loading issues)
- ✅ Support context manager pattern: `async with session_factory() as session:`
- ✅ Auto-close session after context manager exits
- ✅ Support multiple concurrent sessions from same worker
- ✅ Not use `Depends()` pattern (that's for FastAPI routes only)

### Scenario 4: Graceful Shutdown on SIGTERM
**Given** worker is running continuous event loop
**When** Railway sends SIGTERM signal (e.g., during deployment)
**Then** the worker should:
- ✅ Catch SIGTERM signal with signal handler
- ✅ Set shutdown flag to stop accepting new work
- ✅ Wait for current task to complete (if any in progress)
- ✅ Close database connections gracefully
- ✅ Log shutdown message with worker_id
- ✅ Exit with code 0 (successful shutdown)
- ✅ Timeout after 30 seconds if task doesn't complete (Railway timeout)

### Scenario 5: Worker Process Continuous Loop (Placeholder Pattern)
**Given** worker has initialized and entered event loop
**When** the worker runs its main loop
**Then** the worker should:
- ✅ Run infinite `while not shutdown_requested:` loop
- ✅ Sleep briefly between iterations (e.g., 1 second) to prevent CPU spinning
- ✅ Log periodic heartbeat messages (every 60 seconds) confirming worker is alive
- ✅ Catch and log any unexpected exceptions without crashing
- ✅ Continue running until SIGTERM received
- ✅ **Note**: Task claiming logic (PgQueuer integration) will be added in Story 4.2

### Scenario 6: Structured Logging with Worker Identification
**Given** worker is processing tasks or running event loop
**When** any log message is generated
**Then** the structured log should include:
- ✅ worker_id: Unique identifier for this worker process (e.g., "worker-1", "worker-2")
- ✅ timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp
- ✅ level: Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- ✅ message: Human-readable log message
- ✅ correlation_id: Task ID when processing a specific task
- ✅ JSON format: All logs output as JSON for Railway log aggregation
- ✅ stdout: All logs go to stdout (Railway captures automatically)

### Scenario 7: Multiple Workers Run Independently
**Given** 3 workers (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3) are running on Railway
**When** all workers are operational
**Then** the system should demonstrate:
- ✅ Each worker runs in separate Railway service container
- ✅ Workers do not communicate with each other directly
- ✅ Workers share same PostgreSQL database via connection pool
- ✅ Workers can start/stop independently without affecting others
- ✅ One worker crash does not impact other workers
- ✅ Workers can be scaled by adding worker-4, worker-5, etc.

### Scenario 8: Local Development Testing
**Given** developer wants to test worker locally
**When** developer runs `python -m app.worker` in terminal
**Then** the worker should:
- ✅ Start successfully with local DATABASE_URL (sqlite or local postgres)
- ✅ Log startup message to console
- ✅ Run event loop and log heartbeat messages
- ✅ Exit gracefully on Ctrl+C (SIGINT signal)
- ✅ Support running multiple workers in separate terminals for testing
- ✅ Share same local database as web service (if running)

### Scenario 9: Railway Deployment Configuration
**Given** Railway project with worker services defined
**When** `railway.json` is deployed
**Then** Railway should:
- ✅ Create 3 separate worker services (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3)
- ✅ Build all services from same Dockerfile
- ✅ Set start command for workers: `python -m app.worker`
- ✅ Set start command for web: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- ✅ Inject DATABASE_URL environment variable into all services
- ✅ Share PostgreSQL service across web + 3 workers
- ✅ Auto-restart workers on crash (Railway default behavior)

### Scenario 10: Worker Error Handling and Recovery
**Given** worker encounters unexpected exception in main loop
**When** exception is raised
**Then** the worker should:
- ✅ Catch exception in main loop try/except block
- ✅ Log error with full stack trace and worker_id
- ✅ NOT crash the worker process
- ✅ Continue running event loop after logging error
- ✅ Track consecutive error count (alert if >10 errors in 1 minute)
- ✅ Only exit on fatal errors (database unreachable, configuration invalid)

### Core Implementation: `app/worker.py`

**Purpose:** Entry point for worker process, runs continuous event loop with graceful shutdown.

**Required Implementation:**

```python
"""
Worker process entry point for ai-video-generator orchestration platform.

This module implements the foundational worker process that runs as separate Railway
services (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3). Workers execute video generation pipeline
tasks using the services established in Epic 3.

Architecture Pattern:
    - Separate Process: Each worker runs as independent Python process
    - Async Execution: All database operations use async/await patterns
    - Short Transactions: Claim → close DB → process → reopen DB → update
    - Graceful Shutdown: Listens for SIGTERM, finishes current task, exits cleanly

Usage:
    Local Development:
        python -m app.worker

    Railway Deployment:
        Automatic via railway.json configuration
        Start command: python -m app.worker

Provides async engine and session factory for both FastAPI routes (via Depends)
and worker processes (via direct session factory usage).

### Railway Deployment Configuration: `railway.json`

**New File:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**Note**: Railway will create separate services (web, worker-1, worker-2, worker-3) via the Railway dashboard. The `railway.json` provides build configuration, but service topology is configured in the Railway UI.

### Dockerfile Modifications

**Support both web and worker start commands:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install system dependencies (FFmpeg required for video processing)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install uv
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

# Copy project
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN uv sync --frozen

# Expose port for web service (worker doesn't need this, but doesn't hurt)
EXPOSE 8000

# Default command (overridden by Railway service configuration)
# Web service: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
# Worker service: python -m app.worker
CMD ["python", "-m", "app.worker"]
```

### Configuration Loading: `app/config.py`

**Ensure configuration supports worker context:**

### Usage Pattern

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Worker process entry point
# Terminal 1: Start worker locally
python -m app.worker

# Terminal 2: Start another worker
python -m app.worker

# Workers share same database, run independently

# ❌ WRONG: Import worker as module (it's an entry point, not a library)
from app.worker import main
main()  # Don't do this - use python -m app.worker
```

## Dev Agent Guardrails - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 🔥 Architecture Compliance (MANDATORY)

**1. Short Transaction Pattern (Architecture Decision 3 - Placeholder for Story 4.2+):**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Short transactions (will be used in Story 4.2+)
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
    task.status = "processing"
    await db.commit()

# OUTSIDE transaction - NO DB connection held
result = await process_pipeline_step(task)

async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
    task.status = "completed"
    await db.commit()

# ❌ WRONG: Holding transaction during long operation
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
    task.status = "processing"
    result = await process_pipeline_step(task)  # BLOCKS DB!
    task.status = "completed"
    await db.commit()
```

**2. Async Database Operations (SQLAlchemy 2.0 Patterns):**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Async engine and session factory
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession, async_sessionmaker

async_engine = create_async_engine(
    database_url,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=5,
    pool_pre_ping=True
)

AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
    async_engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False
)

# ✅ CORRECT: Worker usage pattern
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
    async with session.begin():
        # Database operations
        pass

# ❌ WRONG: Sync engine or old SQLAlchemy patterns
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(database_url)  # Not async!
```

**3. Graceful Shutdown Pattern:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Signal handler for graceful shutdown
import signal

shutdown_requested = False

def signal_handler(signum: int, frame) -> None:
    global shutdown_requested
    log.info("shutdown_signal_received", signal=signum)
    shutdown_requested = True

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

# Main loop checks shutdown flag
while not shutdown_requested:
    # Work loop
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

# ❌ WRONG: No signal handling (process killed abruptly)
while True:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Never exits gracefully
```

**4. Structured Logging with Worker Identification:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Include worker_id in all log messages
worker_id = os.getenv("RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME", "worker-local")

log.info(
    "worker_heartbeat",
    worker_id=worker_id,
    iteration_count=100,
    consecutive_errors=0
)

# ❌ WRONG: No worker identification in logs
log.info("heartbeat")  # Can't distinguish which worker logged this
```

**5. Connection Pool Configuration:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Shared pool sized for 3 workers + web service
async_engine = create_async_engine(
    database_url,
    pool_size=10,  # 3 workers + web service
    max_overflow=5,
    pool_timeout=30,
    pool_pre_ping=True
)

# ❌ WRONG: Insufficient pool size or missing pre_ping
async_engine = create_async_engine(
    database_url,
    pool_size=5,  # Too small for 3 workers
    pool_pre_ping=False  # Railway connections can go stale
)
```

### 🧠 Previous Story Learnings

**From Epic 3 (Stories 3.1-3.8):**
- ✅ Short transaction pattern works for operations up to 10 minutes (video assembly took 60-120s)
- ✅ Async execution prevents event loop blocking (all services use `async/await`)
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs essential for debugging (JSON format)
- ✅ CLI wrapper pattern (`run_cli_script()`) prevents blocking and handles timeouts
- ✅ Filesystem helpers prevent path traversal attacks (regex validation)
- ✅ Service layer separation (business logic in services, orchestration in workers)

**Git Commit Analysis (Last 5 Commits):**

1. **0d1439c**: Story 3.8 complete - Video assembly with code review fixes
   - Short transaction pattern for 60-120 second FFmpeg operations

- **Error Handling**: Catch, log, classify (retriable vs non-retriable), continue or fail
- **Logging**: JSON format, correlation IDs, worker identification
- **Configuration**: Environment variables only, no hard-coded values

### 📚 Library & Framework Requirements

**Required Libraries (from architecture.md and project-context.md):**
- Python ≥3.10 (async/await, type hints, match statements)
- SQLAlchemy ≥2.0 with AsyncSession (from Story 2.1)
- asyncpg ≥0.29.0 (async PostgreSQL driver)
- structlog (JSON logging from Story 3.1)
- Railway CLI (optional, for local testing with Railway services)

**DO NOT Install:**
- ❌ psycopg2 (use asyncpg instead - async required)
- ❌ SQLAlchemy 1.x (incompatible with 2.0 async patterns)
- ❌ celery (not needed - using PgQueuer in Story 4.2)
- ❌ rq (not needed - using PgQueuer in Story 4.2)

**System Dependencies:**
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Railway managed, provided via DATABASE_URL env var
- **Railway Platform**: $5/month Hobby plan, multi-service deployment

### 🗂️ File Structure Requirements

**MUST Create:**
- `app/worker.py` - Worker process entry point with main loop
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `tests/test_worker.py` - Worker unit tests (10+ test cases)

**MUST Modify:**
- `app/database.py` - Add async engine and session factory with connection pooling
- `app/config.py` - Add worker-specific configuration (if not exists)
- `Dockerfile` - Support both web and worker start commands

**MUST NOT Modify:**
- Any files in `scripts/` directory (brownfield constraint)
- Epic 3 service modules (they're already working)

### 🧪 Testing Requirements

**Minimum Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Worker startup and initialization: 3+ test cases
- ✅ Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT): 2+ test cases
- ✅ Main loop execution: 2+ test cases
- ✅ Error handling and recovery: 3+ test cases
- ✅ Database connection pooling: 2+ test cases
- ✅ Configuration loading: 2+ test cases
- ✅ Graceful shutdown: 2+ test cases

**Mock Strategy:**
- Mock `AsyncSessionLocal()` for database transaction tests
- Mock `asyncio.sleep()` to speed up loop iteration tests
- Mock `os.getenv()` for configuration tests
- Mock signal handlers for shutdown tests
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async test functions

**Test Pattern Example:**
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_worker_startup():
    """Test worker initializes correctly and enters main loop"""
    with patch("app.worker.get_config") as mock_config:
        mock_config.return_value = MagicMock(
            database_url="sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:",
            fernet_key="test-key"
        )
        # Test startup logic
        pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_graceful_shutdown_on_sigterm():
    """Test worker exits cleanly when SIGTERM received"""
    # Mock signal handler and verify shutdown
    pass
```

### 🔒 Security Requirements

**Configuration Security:**
```python
# ✅ All secrets from environment variables
database_url = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")  # Never hard-code
fernet_key = os.getenv("FERNET_KEY")

# ❌ WRONG: Hard-coded secrets
database_url = "postgresql://user:password@host/db"  # NEVER DO THIS
```

**Database URL Logging:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Redact credentials when logging
database_host = config.database_url.split("@")[-1].split("/")[0] if "@" in config.database_url else "local"
log.info("worker_configuration_loaded", database_url_host=database_host)

# ❌ WRONG: Log full DATABASE_URL with credentials
log.info("config_loaded", database_url=config.database_url)  # Exposes password!
```

## Dependencies

**Required Before Starting:**
- ✅ Story 1.1 complete: Database models (Channel, Task, Video) established
- ✅ Story 2.1 complete: Task model with 9-state workflow
- ✅ Story 3.1 complete: Structured logging (`app/utils/logging.py`)
- ✅ Epic 3 complete: All 8 pipeline services implemented
- ✅ PostgreSQL 16: Railway managed database
- ✅ Railway account: $5/month Hobby plan with multi-service support

**Blocks These Stories:**
- Story 4.2: Task Claiming with PgQueuer (needs worker foundation)
- Story 4.3: Priority Queue Management (needs worker + task claiming)
- Story 4.6: Parallel Task Execution (needs full worker infrastructure)
- Epic 5: Review Gates (needs workers to process pipeline)

## Notes & Implementation Hints

**From Architecture (architecture.md):**
- Worker processes run as separate Railway services (worker-1, worker-2, worker-3)
- Each worker independently claims tasks via PgQueuer (Story 4.2)
- Connection pool sized for 3 workers + web service (pool_size=10 sufficient)
- Workers use short transaction pattern: claim → close → process → reopen → update
- Graceful shutdown critical for Railway deployments (SIGTERM sent during deploy)

**From project-context.md:**
- Workers use `AsyncSessionLocal()` directly, NOT `Depends(get_db)` (that's for FastAPI)
- All database operations MUST use async/await patterns
- Structured logging with JSON format for Railway log aggregation
- Configuration from environment variables only (DATABASE_URL, FERNET_KEY)
- Worker_id logged in all messages for debugging multi-worker scenarios

**Worker Process Pattern (Story 4.1):**
```python
# Foundation only - no task processing yet
async def worker_main_loop():
    worker_id = os.getenv("RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME", "worker-local")
    log.info("worker_started", worker_id=worker_id)

    while not shutdown_requested:
        # Heartbeat every 60 seconds
        log.info("worker_heartbeat", worker_id=worker_id)

        # PLACEHOLDER: Task claiming in Story 4.2
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    log.info("worker_shutdown", worker_id=worker_id)
```

**Railway Deployment Strategy:**
- Create 4 services in Railway dashboard: web, worker-1, worker-2, worker-3
- All services use same Dockerfile but different start commands
- Web: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Workers: `python -m app.worker`
- Share DATABASE_URL, FERNET_KEY env vars across all services
- Add RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME to distinguish workers in logs

**Local Development Testing:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start PostgreSQL (or use Railway local)
docker-compose up postgres

# Terminal 2: Start web service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 3: Start worker 1
RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME=worker-1 python -m app.worker

# Terminal 4: Start worker 2
RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME=worker-2 python -m app.worker

# Verify all processes share same database
# Check logs for worker_id to distinguish processes
```

**Connection Pool Sizing:**
- 3 workers × 2 connections average = 6 connections
- 1 web service × 3 connections average = 3 connections
- Total: 9 connections (pool_size=10 provides headroom)
- max_overflow=5 handles burst traffic (up to 15 total connections)
- pool_timeout=30s fails fast if pool exhausted (prevents deadlock)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Worker loop sleeps 1 second between iterations to prevent CPU spinning
- Heartbeat logging every 60 seconds (not every iteration) to reduce log volume
- Consecutive error tracking alerts on excessive errors (>10 in loop)
- Graceful shutdown within 30 seconds (Railway timeout)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Implementation Summary

Implemented worker process foundation following TDD red-green-refactor cycle:

**RED Phase:** Created 18 failing tests covering all 10 acceptance criteria scenarios
**GREEN Phase:** Implemented `app/worker.py` with complete worker process logic
**REFACTOR Phase:** Fixed linting issues (contextlib.suppress), type annotations, deprecation warnings (datetime.utcnow → datetime.now(timezone.utc))

Key implementation decisions:
1. **Worker Entry Point:** Created `app/worker.py` as standalone module with `main()` entry point
2. **Configuration:** Reused existing `app/config.py` functions (get_database_url, get_fernet_key)
3. **Database Exports:** Added `async_engine` and `AsyncSessionLocal` aliases to `app/database.py`
4. **Signal Handling:** Implemented graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers with global shutdown_requested flag
5. **Error Recovery:** Worker continues after exceptions, tracks consecutive errors, logs with context
6. **Heartbeat Logging:** Every 60 seconds with worker_id, iteration_count, consecutive_errors
7. **Structured Logging:** All logs include worker_id for multi-worker debugging
8. **Type Safety:** Full type annotations with WorkerConfig dataclass
9. **Railway Compatibility:** Dockerfile CMD supports both web and worker via Railway service overrides

### Debug Log References

No blocking issues encountered. All tests passed on first implementation after RED phase fixes.
